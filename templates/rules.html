            <p>
                Flat track roller derby is a fast-paced, full-contact sport played on an oval track. Each team has five
                players on the track at a time, including a jammer (the point scorer) and four blockers. Jammers have a
                star
                on their helmet, and one of the blockers, the Pivot, has a stipe.
            </p>
            <p>
                The basic objective of the game is for the jammer to skate through the opposing team's blockers and
                complete
                laps around the track, while the blockers try to stop them and help their own jammer get through. The
                jammer
                scores points for each opposing player they pass on their lap.
            </p>
            <p>
                The game is played in two 30-minute halves, divided into shorter periods of play called "jams" that last
                up
                to two minutes. At the start of each jam, the jammers line up behind the pack of blockers and race to be
                the
                first to break through and become the lead jammer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once a jammer has become the lead jammer, they can choose to end the jam early by placing their hands on
                their hips. This is known as "calling off the jam."
            </p>
            <p>
                Players can use their shoulders, hips, and torso to make contact with other players, but hitting with
                their
                elbows, hands, head, or feet is not allowed. Players who commit a penalty, such as tripping or blocking
                an
                opponent illegally, are sent to the penalty box for 30 seconds, leaving their team short-handed.
            </p>
            <p>
                The team with the most points at the end of the game wins!
